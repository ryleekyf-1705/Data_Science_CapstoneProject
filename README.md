# Data_Science_CapstoneProject
In this project, I will build a prototype to look at a company's sales and the projected sales aimed to achieve for the different financial years.

I importted the appropriate libraries first before embarking on the project.
I have used numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. Numpy is a base N-dimensional array package, pandas are used for data analysis and matplotlib for comprehensive plotting in this project. This is important as it will help with data manipulation and visualisation.

I have created the financial statements, whereby
A stands for Actual
B stands for Budget
P stands for Projected

'NaN' is Not a Number, empty cells for projection. The fourth line (sales) will print a representation of the data. This will enable us to have a sensible representation of it by typing the variable in interactive interpreter.
